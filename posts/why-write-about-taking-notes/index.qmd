I have been taking notes ever
since I learned to write. Most
of my teachers in elementary and
high school required and checked
notes. I initially thought it was
weird to force note taking on
children, but it became a habit
and a skill I carried through
high education and in my
professional life.

I take notes mostly during lectures
and sometimes when journaling.
I, and some of my classmates ^-^,
use my notes to study for exams.
I think I did pretty well in school.
Taking note of things that I find
interesting, paraphrasing the lesson
as I see or hear it, and having the
opportunity to review it anytime
might have helped my studies.

When I started working, I had

to commute a lot, and I had little
opportunity to take notes. Well,
at least the handwritten ones.
With the rise of smartphones and
my work that involved a screen and
keyboard, my few opportunities
of taking notes were relegated to
typewritten documents. It is still
note taking, but I missed my pen
and paper.

A little later, I discovered the
[bullet journal](bulletjournal.com).
It fit my lifestyle then; I still do
it. I was writing daily again.
When I changed career, I was
involved in more meetings and
more learning opportunities, the
bullet journal turned into a
companion in life and learning.

What's my point?

After all these years taking notes,

I thought it is a skill that everyone
knows how to use. But that does not
seem to be the case. I had friends
that photocopied my notes. I judged
them to be lazy note takers, but
maybe they really don't know how
to take notes. I know someone who
admitted they did not know how to
take notes. At first, I found that
odd. Then I thought how amazing it
would be for these people to learn
the power and joy of taking notes.

I believe taking notes is an art
and a science. It requires skill.
It is also fun. And in case it is
not obvious, I prefer taking hand
written notes. A pen gliding on a
surface captures my thoughts and
my emotions better than fingertips
slamming a key cap.

using e- ink on my [Supernote](supernote.com)

In short, I write about taking handwritten notes because I love
writing. Through this writing, I hope my passion on taking handwri­tten notes
would infect and convince more people that everyone should take notes.
