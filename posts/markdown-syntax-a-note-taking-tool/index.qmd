I like easy to follow systems.

I like easy to follow syntax.

For about a decade, I have been
using [markdown](https://www.markdown guide.org) to create
different kinds of documents.
It is easy to type. It is also very
easy to write by hand. However,
I think markdown syntax really
helps me to organize my thoughts
better and share it later on.
I can add hierarchy, division, and
distinction to my notes when I use
markdown in my Supernote. If I
ever have to share my notes to
anyone, I can convert my notes to
TXT then md(markdown) then
render it to any document type
(html, doc, pdf) and retain the
way I organized my thought in my
original note.

I am not here to teach markdown.
Please visit the [guide on basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to learn
and appreciate the simplicity and
beauty of markdown.
It is worth mentioning that
markdown allows formatting
parts of your text without
really seeing that Format until
you render your markdown file or
you see the preview in a text
editor. Rendered or not, I find
that markdown syntax provide a
clear visual cue to my notes.

On a daily basis, I always use
heading and unordered list syn­tax. Heading syntax allows me to
separate my notes into sections.
Bullet list syntax allows me to separate my thoughts.

Heading syntax uses the # symbol
to identify which are headers. The
more #s, the lower their chapter
or section hierarchy. I rarely have
to go to the third level.
I often use this in my [bullet jour­nal](https://bulletjournal.com), the
current week is the first header
and the days are in the second
header.

I use the unordered list syntax (-)
to take note of my thoughts as they come to me throughout the day.
Each bullet in the list indi­cates a train of thought I captured
in that moment.

I don't use it that often, but
when I come across a quote I
really like, I use the block quote
syntax (>) to capture it as a quote
rather than the _normal_

enclosing it in quotes. Again the
intention is for me to be able to
convert it to a formatted text.

A non-markdown syntax I just
started to adapt is the keyword
syntax from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
A keyword or keyphrase is captured inside double
square brackets. It sounds too
much effort to identify a keyword
but I find that it helps me to
be more selective of thoughts
I want to highlight. It gives the
additional benefit of moving my
notes to Obsidian almost seamless.

Markdown syntax is easy to write.
It easy to learn. It is simple yet
clear in adding hierarchy, division,
and distinction to your notes. I only
mentioned a few syntax that I
always use. But I sprinkle a few

in my notes almost all the time.
You might have noticed other
markdown syntax I used in this
post.

Try markdown syntax in your notes.
It just might work For you too. In
any case, markdown is something
everyone should take note.
