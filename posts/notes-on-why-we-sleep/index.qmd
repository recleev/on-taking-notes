My notes on [Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep](https://www.penguin.com.au/books/why-we-sleep-9780141983769)[^footy1]

[^footy1]: I found an old copy in a secondhand book shop. Getting this for a very discounted price is just a miracle.
  The headings and subheadings correspond to the actual sections and chapters in the book, for quick reference and perusal.
  I believe this is such an important book that everyone should read and take note.

# This Thing Called Sleep

## To sleep...

- so far, there is no biological
function that does not benefit
from a good night's sleep

## Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

Losing and Gaining control of Your
Sleep Rhythm

circadian rhythm
: Internal 24-hr rhythm

heliotropism
: plant's leaves or flowers track the trajectory of the sun as it moves across the sky

- circadian clock is about 24: 15
- sunlight resets internal clock to
precisely 24 hrs

zeitgeber
: any signal that thebrain can use to reset internal clock, German for time giver or synchronizer

suprachiasmatic nucleus
: 24-hr biological clock in the brain

- Using spider-web patterns to
determine toxicity, NASA Tech Briefs 9
Webs created under the influence of
caffeine are less Functional than other
drugs (LSD, ampethamine, marijuana)

## Defining and Generating Sleep

Time Dilation and What We
Learned From a Baby in 1952

- more NREM happens at start
of sleep and more REM at end
of sleep. cutting our sleep
short decreases our REM by
60-90%. Sleeping late also
decreases NREM-

Wake → Perception

NREM → Reception

REM → Integration

## Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

Who Sleeps, How Do We Sleep, and How Much?

- we can never "sleep back" that
which we previously lost
- post-prandial alertness dip
(prandium, Latin meaning meal)
the sleepiness in the afternoon
that suggests the need for
bi-phasic sleep (one long at night
and one nap in the afternoon)

## Changes in sleep Across the Life span

- synaptogenesis: stage in Fetal
development where the brain
creates million of synapses with
the help of REM sleep
- deep sleep may be the driving
Force of brain maturation

- adolescents, circadian rhythm
are later than adults, i.e. they
sleep and wake-up later
- the older we get, the more
frequently we wake up at night

# Why You should Sleep?

## Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

The Benefits of sleep for the Brain

- the more the sleep spindles, the
better the capacity of the brain
to learn something new, sleep
spindles occur at the later stage
of sleep, so sleeping less than
six hours reduces the occurrence
of sleep spindles
- early deep NREM sleep provide
superior memory retention, more
deep NREM, more information
retained

8-hour sleep) enhances motor-skill
learning

## Too Extreme For The Guiness Book of World Records

Sleep Deprivation and the Brain[^footy2]

[^footy2]: I have no notes here except for the chapter title. I have a couple of these ^_^;

## Cancer, Heart Attacks, and a shorter Life

Sleep Deprivation and the Body

- leptin signals fullness; ghrelin
signals hunger
- it does not require many nights
of short sleeping before the
body is rendered immunologically
weak

# How and Why We Dream

## Routinely Psychotic

REM-Sleep Dreaming

## Dreaming as Overnight Therapy

epiphenomena
: an unintended by-product or consequence, usually useless

- REM sleep alone is insufficient.
Dreams are necessary
- To sleep, perchance to heal.
Time spent on dream sleep pro­vides emotional healing.
- Dreams must happen when nor-epenephrine is low in the brain to
allow emotional healing
- emotional healing can only occur
in dreaming when the dreams content
deals with the emotion and the
context of the emotion, i. e. one

cannot heal from the pain of a
break-up by dreaming of a beach
- REM sleep recalibrates the region
of the brain that reads and decodes
the value and meaning of emotional
signals

## Dream creativity and Dream Control

- REM sleep fuses and blends elemen­tal ingredients together, in abstract
and highly novel aways
- both the act of dreaming and the
associated content of those dreams
determine creative success
- REM sleep allows the brain to move
beyond learning and truly grasp
comprehension
- lucid dreaming, i. e. controlling a
dream is real

# From Sleeping Pills to Society Transformed

## Things that Go Bump in the Night

Sleep Disorders and Death Caused by No Sleep

Somnambulism
: sleep disorders that involve some form of movement

Insomia
: suffering from an inade­quate ability to generate sleep
despite allowing oneself the ade­quate opportunity to get sleep (this
is not to be confused with sleep deprivation: having the adequate
ability to sleep yet giving oneself an inadequate opportunity to sleep)

onset insomnia
: difficulty falling asleep

maintenance insomnia
: difficulty staying asleep

narcolepsy
: three main symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness,

sleep paralysis, and cataplexy

fatal familial insomnia
: genetic disorder, caused by a mutation in prion protein gene, that prevents one
to sleep, fatal within 10 months

## iPads, Factory Vhistles, and
Nightcaps

- alcohol degrades REM sleep and
learning as much as three nights
after initial learning
- alarms cause sudden increase in
blood pressure and shock accelera­tion in heart rate: this happens
repeatedly when snoozing the
alarm

## Hurting and Helping Your Sleep

Pills us. Therapy
- "sleeping" pills are sedatives; they
attack the same brain receptors
as alcohol

- majority of prescription "sleeping"
pills are physically addictive

## Sleep and Society

What Medicine and Education are
doing Wrong, What Google and NASA
are doing Right

- Those who sleep more earn
more money
- REM sleep is what stands
between rationality and insani­ty.

## New Vision of Sleep in the
Twenty-First Century

- sleep credit with financial of
vacation incentive can help pro­mote healthy
