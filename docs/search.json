    "title": "Why Write About Taking Notes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been taking notes ever since I learned to write. Most of my teachers in elementary and high school required and checked notes. I initially thought it was weird to force note taking on children, but it became a habit and a skill I carried through high education and in my professional life.\nI take notes mostly during lectures and sometimes when journaling. I, and some of my classmates -, use my notes to study for exams. I think I did pretty well in school. Taking note of things that I find interesting, paraphrasing the lesson as I see or hear it, and having the opportunity to review it anytime might have helped my studies.\nWhen I started working, I had\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto commute a lot, and I had little opportunity to take notes. Well, at least the handwritten ones. With the rise of smartphones and my work that involved a screen and keyboard, my few opportunities of taking notes were relegated to typewritten documents. It is still note taking, but I missed my pen and paper.\nA little later, I discovered the bullet journal. It fit my lifestyle then; I still do it. I was writing daily again. When I changed career, I was involved in more meetings and more learning opportunities, the bullet journal turned into a companion in life and learning.\nWhat’s my point?\nAfter all these years taking notes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it is a skill that everyone knows how to use. But that does not seem to be the case. I had friends that photocopied my notes. I judged them to be lazy note takers, but maybe they really don’t know how to take notes. I know someone who admitted they did not know how to take notes. At first, I found that odd. Then I thought how amazing it would be for these people to learn the power and joy of taking notes.\nI believe taking notes is an art and a science. It requires skill. It is also fun. And in case it is not obvious, I prefer taking hand written notes. A pen gliding on a surface captures my thoughts and my emotions better than fingertips slamming a key cap. I am genera­lizing here because I also write\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing e- ink on my Supernote\nIn short, I write about taking handwritten notes because I love writing. Through this writing, I hope my passion on taking handwri­tten notes would infect and convince more people that everyone should take notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
