    "title": "Why Write About Taking Notes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been taking notes ever since I learned to write. Most of my teachers in elementary and high school required and checked notes. I initially thought it was weird to force note taking on children, but it became a habit and a skill I carried through high education and in my professional life.\nI take notes mostly during lectures and sometimes when journaling. I, and some of my classmates -, use my notes to study for exams. I think I did pretty well in school. Taking note of things that I find interesting, paraphrasing the lesson as I see or hear it, and having the opportunity to review it anytime might have helped my studies.\nWhen I started working, I had\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto commute a lot, and I had little opportunity to take notes. Well, at least the handwritten ones. With the rise of smartphones and my work that involved a screen and keyboard, my few opportunities of taking notes were relegated to typewritten documents. It is still note taking, but I missed my pen and paper.\nA little later, I discovered the bullet journal. It fit my lifestyle then; I still do it. I was writing daily again. When I changed career, I was involved in more meetings and more learning opportunities, the bullet journal turned into a companion in life and learning.\nWhat’s my point?\nAfter all these years taking notes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it is a skill that everyone knows how to use. But that does not seem to be the case. I had friends that photocopied my notes. I judged them to be lazy note takers, but maybe they really don’t know how to take notes. I know someone who admitted they did not know how to take notes. At first, I found that odd. Then I thought how amazing it would be for these people to learn the power and joy of taking notes.\nI believe taking notes is an art and a science. It requires skill. It is also fun. And in case it is not obvious, I prefer taking hand written notes. A pen gliding on a surface captures my thoughts and my emotions better than fingertips slamming a key cap. I am genera­lizing here because I also write\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing e- ink on my Supernote\nIn short, I write about taking handwritten notes because I love writing. Through this writing, I hope my passion on taking handwri­tten notes would infect and convince more people that everyone should take notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "title": "Markdown Syntax: A Note Taking Tool",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I like easy to follow systems.\nI like easy to follow syntax.\nFor about a decade, I have been using markdown to create different kinds of documents. It is easy to type. It is also very easy to write by hand. However, I think markdown syntax really helps me to organize my thoughts better and share it later on. I can add hierarchy, division, and distinction to my notes when I use markdown in my Supernote. If I ever have to share my notes to anyone, I can convert my notes to TXT then md(markdown) then render it to any document type (html, doc, pdf) and retain the way I organized my thought in my original note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not here to teach markdown. Please visit the guide on basic syntax to learn and appreciate the simplicity and beauty of markdown. It is worth mentioning that markdown allows formatting parts of your text without really seeing that Format until you render your markdown file or you see the preview in a text editor. Rendered or not, I find that markdown syntax provide a clear visual cue to my notes.\nOn a daily basis, I always use heading and unordered list syn­tax. Heading syntax allows me to separate my notes into sections. Bullet list syntax allows me to separate my thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading syntax uses the # symbol to identify which are headers. The more #s, the lower their chapter or section hierarchy. I rarely have to go to the third level. I often use this in my bullet jour­nal, the current week is the first header and the days are in the second header.\nI use the unordered list syntax (-) to take note of my thoughts as they come to me throughout the day. Each bullet in the list indi­cates a train of thought I captured in that moment.\nI don’t use it that often, but when I come across a quote I really like, I use the block quote syntax (&gt;) to capture it as a quote rather than the normal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenclosing it in quotes. Again the intention is for me to be able to convert it to a formatted text.\nA non-markdown syntax I just started to adapt is the keyword syntax from Obsidian. A keyword or keyphrase is captured inside double square brackets. It sounds too much effort to identify a keyword but I find that it helps me to be more selective of thoughts I want to highlight. It gives the additional benefit of moving my notes to Obsidian almost seamless.\nMarkdown syntax is easy to write. It easy to learn. It is simple yet clear in adding hierarchy, division, and distinction to your notes. I only mentioned a few syntax that I always use. But I sprinkle a few\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin my notes almost all the time. You might have noticed other markdown syntax I used in this post.\nTry markdown syntax in your notes. It just might work For you too. In any case, markdown is something everyone should take note.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
