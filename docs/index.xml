  <title>Why Write About Taking Notes</title>

</div>
<div class="text">
<p>I have been taking notes ever since I learned to write. Most of my teachers in elementary and high school required and checked notes. I initially thought it was weird to force note taking on children, but it became a habit and a skill I carried through high education and in my professional life.</p>
<p>I take notes mostly during lectures and sometimes when journaling. I, and some of my classmates <sup>-</sup>, use my notes to study for exams. I think I did pretty well in school. Taking note of things that I find interesting, paraphrasing the lesson as I see or hear it, and having the opportunity to review it anytime might have helped my studies.</p>
<p>When I started working, I had</p>

</div>
<div class="text">
<p>to commute a lot, and I had little opportunity to take notes. Well, at least the handwritten ones. With the rise of smartphones and my work that involved a screen and keyboard, my few opportunities of taking notes were relegated to typewritten documents. It is still note taking, but I missed my pen and paper.</p>
<p>A little later, I discovered the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com">bullet journal</a>. It fit my lifestyle then; I still do it. I was writing daily again. When I changed career, I was involved in more meetings and more learning opportunities, the bullet journal turned into a companion in life and learning.</p>
<p>What’s my point?</p>
<p>After all these years taking notes,</p>

</div>
<div class="text">
<p>I thought it is a skill that everyone knows how to use. But that does not seem to be the case. I had friends that photocopied my notes. I judged them to be lazy note takers, but maybe they really don’t know how to take notes. I know someone who admitted they did not know how to take notes. At first, I found that odd. Then I thought how amazing it would be for these people to learn the power and joy of taking notes.</p>
<p>I believe taking notes is an art and a science. It requires skill. It is also fun. And in case it is not obvious, I prefer taking hand written notes. A pen gliding on a surface captures my thoughts and my emotions better than fingertips slamming a key cap. I am genera­lizing here because I also write</p>
