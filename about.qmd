This blog is dedicated to
taking handwritten notes,
or any element and aspect
related to it.

It is a love letter, maybe even
a memoir, about the art, science,
practice, and joy of taking notes.

The blog's title is inspired
by Stephen King's On Writing
and Willian Zinsser's On
Writing Well.

Written and rendered with

Built and published with

Writing emoticon copied from
